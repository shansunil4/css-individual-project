<h1 class="fancy">A LAND FOR All TASTES</h1> 
<p>AS a bridge between Europe and Asia, Turkey has so much to offer visitors:
breathtaking natural beauty, unique historical and archaeological sites,
steadily improving hotel and touristic infrastructure and a tradition of hospitality and competitive prices.
Therefore, it is not surprising that Turkey has become one of the worldâ€™s most popular tourism destinations.</p>

<p>In Turkey you will experience an incredible diversity in nature, culture, history, beliefs and ideas. 
This in itself may not be a challenge for the seasoned traveller.</p> 

<p>After all, diversity is the most prized feature of favourite destinations. 
In Turkey this diversity is rich enough to challenge even the most experienced eye because
 it is packed into tight spaces with abrupt changes of scenery. 
 </p> 
 
 <p>This is why people sometimes describe the Turkish landscape as a "symphony of sounds, 
 smells and people in the most unlikely combinations of appearance and action".</p>
 
 <p class="clear">Due to Turkey's diverse geography, one can experience four different climates in any one day. 
 This rectangular-shaped country is bordered on three sides by three different seas. 
 Its shores are laced with beaches, bays, coves, ports, islands and peninsulas.</p>

<p>The country is rich in hot springs, healing waters and mud baths, 
which are highly recommended by the medical authorities as a remedy for many diseases. 
But Turkey is above all a huge open-air museum, a repository of all the civilisations nurtured by the soils of Anatolia.</p>
